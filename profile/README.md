## dash vs underscore madness

Github does not allow underscore in Organization name or Username.  
This is because underscore cannot be used in internet domain names or subdomain names.  
But it is allowed in repository names.  
I preffer using underscore because of Rust naming conventions.  
I will use underscore everywhere except where is not possible. There I will convert them to dashes.
